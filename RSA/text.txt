RSA algorithm is an asymmetric cryptography algorithm. Asymmetric actually means that it works on two different keys i.e. Public Key and Private Key. As the name describes that the Public Key is given to everyone and the Private key is kept private.

An example of asymmetric cryptography: 

A client (for example browser) sends its public key to the server and requests some data.
The server encrypts the data using the clientâ€™s public key and sends the encrypted data.
The client receives this data and decrypts it.
Since this is asymmetric, nobody else except the browser can decrypt the data even if a third party has the public key of the browser.
